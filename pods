Create the monolith pod
kubectl create -f pods/monolith.yaml
Examine pods
kubectl get pods
It may take a few seconds before the monolith pod is up and running as the monolith container image needs to be pulled from the Docker Hub before we can run it.

Use the kubectl describe command to get more information about the monolith pod.

kubectl describe pods monolith

kubectl port-forward monolith 10080:80

You can use the kubectl exec command to run an interactive shell inside the monolith Pod. This can come in handy when you want to troubleshoot from within a container:

kubectl exec monolith --stdin --tty -c monolith /bin/sh
For example, once we have a shell into the monolith container we can test external connectivity using the ping command.

ping -c 3 google.com
When youâ€™re done with the interactive shell be sure to logout.
